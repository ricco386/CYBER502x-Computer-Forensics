Unit 1
~~~~~~

The evidence may reside in computer systems, computer networks, computer media, computer peripherals -- basically everywhere.
Data can be in one of the three states: At rest, which means stored in a computer drive, the Cloud, or a USB drive, etc, a mobile phone; data in use, which means data is in a computer's memory currently in use; or data in transit, which means moving through a network.

**System forensics** focus on evidence from volatile data, such as data in memory, and non-volatile data, which resides in hard drives; computer discs;, floppy discs; magnetic tapes; zip and the JAZ discs; log files;

**Network forensics** determines what happened on a system based on network traffic study, such as timeline analysis, IP address, or contents of the packets. This task is technically challenging since this evidence is often transient and does not last as long as stored media.

**Cloud forensics** is an emerging area focusing on Cloud-based evidence, such as Google Drives, web-based email stored on servers owned by a third party.

**Anti-digital forensics or ADF**, which are technologies designed to thwart discovery of such information. ADF approaches aim to manipulate, erase, or obfuscate digital data to make forensic examination difficult, time-consuming, or virtually impossible.

**Expert witness** present in court to judges, attorneys, juries, and other attendants to state their findings, opinions, and conclusions within the bounds of the trial.
